# Here is a sample solution for the cardinality of a set
size = lambda x: len(x.keys())


# `set_from_list` -- takes a list and returns a set.

# `list_from_set` -- do the reverse of above. 


# `add` -- takes a set and an element and returns a new set with the element added.


# `remove` -- takes a set and an element and returns a new set with the element removed.


# `union`


# `intersection`


# `difference`


# `symmetric_difference` -- the elements that are in exactly one of the sets.


# `is_subset_of`


# `is_superset_of`
